## üß© Overview  

**Apple Compressor for macOS** is a professional-grade video encoding tool tailored for filmmakers, editors, and content creators who require complete control over their export process. It delivers exceptional performance when paired with **Final Cut Pro** and **Motion**, ensuring seamless media preparation for any platform or format.  

Compressor supports **ProRes, HEVC, H.264**, and **HDR** formats, allowing you to produce high-quality outputs for streaming services, cinema, and broadcast. You can build custom export profiles, automate repetitive tasks, and batch-process large volumes of media to save time and maintain consistency across projects.
